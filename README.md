Tac Symbolic Executor
---------------------

This is symbolic executor I implemented for CMSC631, *Program Analysis and Understanding*. It is written in OCaml and makes use of the constraint solver OCamlSTP. The meat of the implementation is in the *se.ml* file and the project specification for the class can be found [here](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2011/cmsc631/p2.shtml).
